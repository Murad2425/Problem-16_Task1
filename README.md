## Introduction 
This the the information of student's performance data.
A set of data given of a college such as Student Name, Student Id, Subject, Score, Attendance, and assignment completion.
So, after analysing all the data I got the performance among the students there. This project is a Python program designed to analyze and visualize student performance data. It utilizes concepts like file handling, data structures, functions, loops, NumPy, and Pandas.

## Project Task
 # 1. Data Collection and Storage 
 - Simulate or create a CSV file containing:Student Name, Student ID, Subject, Score, Attendance Percentage, Assignment Completion (Yes/No)
 # 2. Basic Data Handling 
 - Use File Handling to:
Read data from the CSV file.
Write modified or updated data back to a new CSV file
# 3. Data Analysis and Manipulation 
 - Pandas and DataFrames:
Analyze average, minimum, and maximum scores per student.
Identify students with attendance below 75% or missing assignments.
 - Boolean Indexing: Filter students failing specific subjects.
Data Type Conversion: Convert scores to integers if stored as strings.
# 4. Visualisation 
 - Matplotlib/Pandas Visualization:
Bar chart: Average scores by subject.
Pie chart: Attendance percentage categories (<50%, 50-75%, >75%).
Line graph: Performance trends over time for a selected student.
# 5. Function Implementation 
 - Modularize logic with functions for improved readability and reuse

## Tools and Libraries 
Python: Core language for implementation.
NumPy: Numerical computation.
Pandas: Data handling and manipulation.
Matplotlib: Visualization and graphical analysis.
Regular Expressions: Validation of input patterns.

## How to Run the Project
 1. Clone this repository to your local machine
 2. Install the required Python libraries
 3. Place the CSV file with student data in the project directory.
 4. Run the Python script using
 5. Follow the interactive prompts for analyzing and managing student data

## Conclusion 
This project provides an effective tool for analyzing and visualizing student performance data using Python. By integrating essential programming concepts like data handling, analysis, and visualization, it offers a practical approach to understanding trends and insights from educational data. Additionally, the optional advanced features demonstrate the potential for further customization and scalability. This project not only helps to enhance programming skills but also provides a foundation for developing real-world data-driven applications.
